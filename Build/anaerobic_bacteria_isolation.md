## 1. Purpose  
This document explains the process for isolating facultative anaerobic denitrifying bacteria from existing wastewater and surface drainage locations.

---

## 2. Target Bacteria  
We attempt to isolate indigenous facultative anaerobes from wet locations near the proposed denitrifying bioreactor.  
This process is based largely on **Van Niel and Allen (1952)**, which focuses on the isolation of *Pseudomonas stutzeri* — a well-documented anaerobe found worldwide. *P. stutzeri* is among the most efficient bacteria for converting nitrate (NO₃⁻) into nitrogen gas (N₂).

Earlier work by **Van Iterson (1902)** demonstrated that denitrifying bacteria can be isolated using simple accumulation methods.  
In practice, you will always obtain a **consortia** of denitrifying bacteria rather than a single axenic species.  
Modern **16S rRNA sequencing** can be used to fingerprint the bacterial community within the bioreactor at any time.

### Environmental Requirements  
To maintain healthy and effective cultures:

- Dissolved oxygen (DO) ≈ 1 mg/L  
- pH = 6.8–7.8  
- Temperature > 50 °F (10 °C)  
- Minimize sulfur: excess sulfur promotes sulfur-reducing bacteria  
- Maintain appropriate **C :N :P** ratios (Redfield Ratio)

## 3. Isolation Process  

This method is suitable for a single bioreactor tank of about **500 gallons**. Larger tanks may require multiple samples.

1. Identify a permanent water source (creek, estuary, slough, or drainage ditch) exposed to agricultural nitrates.  
2. Collect **1–2 gallons** of benthic mud from the bottom.  
3. Mix the sample with distilled water to a total volume of 3–5 gallons.  
4. Add **ethanol**, **methanol**, or a mixture to reach **≈ 1000 mg/L** carbon.  
5. Add nitrate fertilizer until nitrate = **≈ 1000 mg/L**. Verify with a probe.  
6. Add **orthophosphate** fertilizer to reach **≈ 40 mg/L P**.  
7. Seal the container airtight and incubate **7 days** at **> 50 °F**.  
8. Observe formation of fine uniform bubbles (N₂ gas).  
9. Around **day 3**, check nitrate concentration:  
   - If NO₃⁻ decreases → denitrification is proceeding.  
   - If unchanged → process failed; restart.

> **Note 1:** Ethanol/methanol is not mandatory. Over 20 carbon sources have been used successfully (EPA 2013). These alcohols are simply the most accessible.

## 4. Growth and Transfer  

Once denitrification is confirmed:

1. Ensure bioreactor tanks are complete and contain MBBR media.  
2. Fill tanks with water.  
3. Open the carbon-injection port.  
4. Using a **2–5 GPM diaphragm pump**, inject the entire inoculum (mud, water, solids) into the bioreactor.  
5. Add 1000 mg/L carbon + 40 mg/L phosphorus (as liquid mixture).  
6. Let the reactor stand **1 week**.  
7. Re-dose with the same mixture, then pump water slowly for one full **hydraulic residence time** (~60 min) to displace contents.  
8. Observe effluent: bubbles indicate activity.  
9. If you detect **H₂S odor (rotten eggs)** and no bubbles, sulfur-reducing bacteria have colonized — restart the process.

## 5. Full Inoculation  

Continuous access to wastewater and knowledge of incoming NO₃⁻ and PO₄³⁻ levels are essential.  
If phosphorus is low, supplement the carbon source with additional phosphorus.

---

## 6. Phosphorus as the Limiting Agent  

Phosphorus (PO₄³⁻) deficiency can limit denitrification even when the redox potential (ORP) is within −50 to +50 mV.  
Typical wastewater practice uses an **N :P ratio of 20:1 to 25:1**, confirmed by Tailwater Systems.

For example, if NO₃-N = 10 lb h⁻¹, inject:

- 10 / 20 = 0.5 lb h⁻¹ P  or  10 / 25 = 0.4 lb h⁻¹ P.  

Use standard **orthophosphate fertilizer** dissolved in water for dosing.

---

## 7. Inoculation Procedure  

1. Measure incoming nitrate (NO₃-N) and phosphorus (P).  
2. Connect carbon source and add P as needed.  
3. Set metering pump: **≈ 6 g C per 1 g N** removed.  
4. Reduce flow to **¼ normal** rate during startup.  
5. Operate ~ 4 h/day, 7 days/week.  
6. Use **nitrate test strips** for inlet/outlet checks.  
7. When outlet NO₃ < 5 mg/L for several consecutive days → ready for normal operation.

---

## 8. Nitrate and Phosphorus Testing  

Most nitrate test strips show **NO₃⁻** and **NO₂⁻**.  
Nitrite buildup indicates insufficient carbon. Increase carbon feed until nitrite disappears.  
Use phosphorus strips to monitor effluent P; excess P may cause algal growth. Adjust inlet dosing accordingly.
