# BioTreat | TileMaster Bioreactor Operation Guide

**System type:** Unpressurized, upflow, fixed-volume MBBR  
**Nominal flow:** 15 GPM  
**Mode:** Continuous, automatically permissive (float-switch controlled)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document describes normal operation and routine monitoring for the **BioTreat TileMaster Bioreactor**.  
The system is designed for minimal operator intervention while maintaining consistent nitrate removal in agricultural drainage and tile flows.

---

## 2. General Operating Principles

- The TileMaster operates continuously whenever the **supply tank float switch** is closed.  
- Flow enters at the tank bottom through the distributor and rises evenly through the floating carrier bed.  
- Denitrifying bacteria on the carriers convert nitrate (NO₃⁻) to nitrogen gas (N₂) using carbon as an electron donor.  
- The system is **unpressurized**, operating at near-atmospheric head.  
- Carbon feed is proportional to flow and rarely needs adjustment once tuned.

---

## 3. Operational Stability

TileMaster systems are **extremely reliable**.  
Once established, they can operate **for days or weeks** with no external input.

**Routine adjustments are minimal:**
- The **carbon feed rate** (via the Stenner pump) should only be changed if:
  - Effluent nitrate begins to rise steadily (increase carbon), or  
  - Effluent nitrate drops to zero (decrease carbon slightly).  
- Constant zero-nitrate operation is **not recommended**, as it can cause carbon waste and unwanted bacterial overgrowth.

---

## 4. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### 4.1 Baseline Pressure Check

- During startup, record the **baseline system pressure** at the supply pump discharge or bottom manifold line.  
- This represents the backpressure of the tank when clean and freshly bio-coated.  
- Over time, if pressure **increases above baseline**, investigate for:
  - Blockage at inlet (sand, algae, debris coating bioballs), or  
  - Obstruction at outlet or suction strainer.

**Tip:** Pressure monitoring is more useful than ORP or DO sensors for long-term reliability checks.

### 4.2 Sample Collection

- During the **first month of operation**, collect inlet and outlet samples weekly and submit to a **licensed water testing lab**.  
- Use ½″ ball-valve sampling ports installed in the flow path.  
- Record nitrate (NO₃-N), nitrite (NO₂-N), pH, and alkalinity.  
- After baseline confirmation, reduce lab testing to quarterly unless conditions change.

## 5. Nutrient Balance and Chemical Ratios

Maintaining the correct **C:N:P ratio** ensures sustained microbial health and nitrate reduction.

| Parameter | Typical Ratio | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **C:N:P** | 100 : 20 : 1 | Baseline ratio for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus |
| **Carbon dose** | 5 parts C : 1 part N | Increase slightly if NO₃ removal declines |
| **Phosphorus** | 1 part P : 20 parts N | Add soluble phosphorus if influent is deficient |

### Phosphorus Supplementation
If the source water lacks phosphorus:
1. Install a small **metering pump** and a tank containing a **water-soluble phosphorus solution** (e.g., mono- or di-ammonium phosphate).  
2. Inject this in proportion to flow, near the carbon tee or inlet line.

---

## 6. Operational Best Practices

- **Do not over-dose carbon.** A faint nitrate residual (1–5 mg/L NO₃–N) is optimal.  
- **Keep feed water free of solids** — use coarse inlet screening if algae or sediment are present.  
- **Observe flow uniformity.** Standing waves or surface turbulence indicate short-circuiting or uneven distributor performance.  
- **Monitor visually**: clear zone below the media should remain 30–40 % of tank volume.  
- **Avoid frequent restarts** — stable temperature and flow maintain a healthy biofilm.  
- **During heavy rainfall**, confirm that float switch and pump circuit respond normally to changing inflow rates.

## 7. Common Operational Issues

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Corrective Action |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Rising backpressure | Inlet or outlet blockage | Inspect distributor and suction strainer |
| Poor nitrate removal | Carbon under-fed | Increase Stenner rate slightly |
| Zero nitrate for extended period | Carbon over-fed | Reduce Stenner rate 10–20 % |
| Algae or solids buildup | No pre-screening on feed | Add inlet filter or flush line |
| Floating media clumped | Biofilm too thick / low mixing | Flush or agitate tank gently during downtime |

---

## 8. Maintenance Interval (Quick Reference)

| Frequency | Task |
|------------|------|
| Weekly | Observe flow and pressure gauge |
| Monthly | Verify carbon feed volume and tubing condition |
| Quarterly | Lab sample verification and visual tank inspection |
| Annual | Drain and clean distributor and suction strainer |

## 9. Appendix

### A. Operating Philosophy

The TileMaster’s simplicity is its strength.  
Because it is unpressurized and self-regulating, nearly all system feedback can be inferred from flow rate, pressure, and nitrate concentration alone.

### B. Recommended Monitoring Hierarchy

1. Flow rate (primary)  
2. Backpressure (secondary)  
3. Effluent NO₃–N (confirmation)  
4. Visual carrier activity (qualitative check)
